Welcome to my coding repository! This repository contains my learning journey, problem-solving, and projects in C, C++, Java, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). Here, you'll find:
✅ DSA implementations (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, sorting, searching, etc.)
✅ Solutions to coding problems from LeetCode, CodeChef, and HackerRank
✅ Practice programs in C, C++, and Java
✅ Notes and resources for learning
